# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-AI-
Excited to share my latest Python project: a Tic-Tac-Toe game! This project goes beyond a simple implementation, exploring different player strategies including a smart computer opponent powered by the minimax algorithm. I've focused on clean code and object-oriented principles to create a maintainable and extensible game.
